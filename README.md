Idle Alert is an application for Brighter Shores, a PC game created by Andrew Gower, the creator of RuneScape. The purpose of this app is to alert you whenever you're idle during crafting or combat. Iâ€™ve included a video guide in the app for anyone who needs assistance.

Idle Alert is an open-source application, and I want this project to reach as many people as possible. My mission is to help others, and I hope this app will be useful to them.
