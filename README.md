Idle Alert is an application for Brighter Shores, a game created by Andrew Gower, the creator of RuneScape. The purpose of this app is to alert you whenever you become idle during crafting or combat.

Inside the app, I’ve included a video guide for anyone seeking assistance. The video will walk you through the process — it’s clear, simple, and easy to follow. I chose to make this app open-source, as it’s a passion project I’m excited to share with the community.

Thank you to everyone who has used this app — your support truly means a lot to me. I hope it proves helpful to you on your journey.
